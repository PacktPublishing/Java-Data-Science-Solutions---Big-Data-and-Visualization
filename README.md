# Java Data Science Solutions - Big Data and Visualization [Video]
This is the code repository for [Java Data Science Solutions - Big Data and Visualization [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/java-data-science-solutions-big-data-and-visualization-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788391535), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
If you are looking to build data science models that are good for production, Java has come to the rescue. With the aid of strong libraries such as MLlib, Weka, DL4j, and more, you can efficiently perform all the data science tasks you need to. This course will help you to learn how you can retrieve data from data sources with different level of complexities. You will learn how you could handle big data to extract meaningful insights from data. Later we will dive to visualizing data to uncover trends and hidden relationships. Finally, we will work through unique videos that solve your problems while taking data science to production, writing distributed data science applications, and much moreâ€”things that will come in handy at work.
